# Bank Account System
This simple Java program takes commands from .txt files and processes accordingly. 
Phase 1,2,3 of the text files works perfectly.

## I have learned:
- Working with multiple java class and connect them in-between
- Handling errors and exeptions properly.
- Understand the ideas of object orientations.

PS: Phase 4 needs some work and fixing.
